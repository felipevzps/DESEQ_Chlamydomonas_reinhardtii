#Normalization - Some way to address and normalize the following:
# - Within sample: For technical biases that affect detected counts
# - Between sample: For technical biases like lib preparation
# - Between batches: For systemic sources of variation and technical noise due to factors that cluster data independent of your experimental design.

#Normalize between samples for sequencing depth bias

#Note: the output myresults@results[[1]]$prob gives the estimated probability of differential expression for each feature. These probabilities are not equivalent to p-values. The higher the probability, the more likely that the difference in expression is due to the change in the experimental condition and not to chance.
